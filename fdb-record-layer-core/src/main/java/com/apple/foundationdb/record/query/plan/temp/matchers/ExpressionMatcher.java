/**
 * A <code>ExpressionMatcher</code> is an expression that can be matched against a
 * {@link PlannerExpression} tree, while binding certain expressions/references in the tree to expression matcher objects.
 * The bindings can be retrieved from the rule call once the binding is matched.
 * Extreme care should be taken when implementing <code>ExpressionMatcher</code>, since it can be very delicate.
 * In particular, expression matchers may (or may not) be reused between successive rule calls and should be stateless.
 * Additionally, implementors of <code>ExpressionMatcher</code> must use the (default) reference equals.
 * @param <T> the bindable type that this matcher binds to
